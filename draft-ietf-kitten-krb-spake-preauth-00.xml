    <abstract>
      <t>This document defines a new pre-authentication mechanism for the
      Kerberos protocol that uses a password authenticated key exchange. This
      document has three goals. First, increase the security of Kerberos
      pre-authentication exchanges by making offline brute-force attacks
      infeasible.  Second, enable the use of second factor authentication
      without relying on FAST. This is achieved using the existing trust
      relationship established by the shared first factor. Third, make
      Kerberos pre-authentication more resilient against time synchronization
      errors by removing the need to transfer an encrypted timestamp from the
      client.
      </t>
    </abstract>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>When a client uses PA-ENC-TIMESTAMP (or similar schemes, or the KDC
      does not require preauthentication), a passive attacker that observes
      either the AS-REQ or AS-REP can perform an offline brute-force attack
      against the transferred ciphertext.  When the client principal's
      long-term key is based on a password, offline dictionary attacks can
      successfuly recover the key, with only modest effort needed if the
      password is weak.</t>

      <section title="Properties of PAKE">
        <t>Password authenticated key exchange (PAKE) algorithms provide
        several properties which are useful to overcome this problem and make
        them ideal for use as a Kerberos pre-authentication mechanism.
        <list style="numbers">
          <t>Each side of the exchange contributes entropy.</t>
          <t>Passive attackers cannot determine the shared key.</t>
          <t>Active attackers cannot perform a man-in-the-middle attack.</t>
          <t>Either side can store a password or password equivalent.</t>
        </list></t>

        <t>These properties of PAKE allow us to establish high-entropy
        encryption keys resistant to offline brute force attack, even when
        the passwords used are weak (low-entropy).</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Which PAKE?">
        <t>Diffie-Hellman Encrypted Key Exchange (DH-EKE) is the earliest
        widely deployed PAKE. It works by encrypting the public keys of a
        Diffie-Hellman key exchange with a shared secret. However, it
        requires both that unauthenticated encryption be used and that the
        public keys be indistinguishable from random data. This last
        requirement makes it impossible to use this form of PAKE with elliptic
        curve cryptography. For these reasons, DH-EKE is not a good fit.</t>

        <t>Password authenticated key exchange by juggling (JPAKE) permits
        the use of elliptic curve cryptography. However, it too has drawbacks.
        First, the additional computation required for the algorithm makes
        it resource intensive for servers under load. Second, it requires an
        additional network round-trip, increasing latency and load on the
        network.</t>

        <t>SPAKE is a variant of the technique used by DH-EKE which ensures
        that all public key encryption and decryption operations result in a
        member of the underlying group. This property allows SPAKE to be used
        with elliptic curve cryptography, which is believed to provide
        equivalent security levels to finite-field DH key exchange at much
        smaller key sizes. Additionally, SPAKE can complete the key exchange
        in just a single round-trip. These properties make SPAKE an ideal PAKE
        to use for Kerberos pre-authentication.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="PAKE and Two-Factor Authentication">
        <t>Using PAKE in a pre-authentication mechanism also has another
        benefit when used as a component of two-factor authentication (2FA).
        2FA methods often require the secure transfer of plaintext material to
        the KDC for verification. This includes one-time passwords,
        challenge/response signatures and biometric data. Attempting to
        encrypt this data using the long-term secret results in packets that
        are vulnerable to offline brute-force attack if either authenticated
        encryption is used or if the plaintext is distinguishable from random
        data. This is a problem that PAKE solves for first factor
        authentication. So a similar technique can be used with PAKE to
        encrypt second-factor data.</t>

        <t>In the OTP pre-authentication <xref target="RFC6560"/> specification,
        this problem is mitigated by using FAST, which uses a secondary trust
        relationship to create a secure encryption channel within which
        pre-authentication data can be sent. However, the requirement for a
        secondary trust relationship has proven to be cumbersome to deploy and
        often introduces third parties into the trust chain (such as
        certification authorities). These requirements lead to a scenario
        where FAST cannot be enabled by default without sufficient
        configuration. SPAKE pre-authentication, in contrast, can create a
        secure encryption channel implicitly, using the key exchange to
        negotiate a high-entropy encryption key. This key can then be used to
        securely encrypt 2FA plaintext data without the need for a secondary
        trust relationship. Further, if the second factor verifiers are sent
        at the same time as the first factor verifier, and the KDC is careful
        to prevent timing attacks, then an online brute-force attack cannot be
        used to attack the factors separately.</t>

        <t>For these reasons, this draft departs from the advice given in
        Section 1 of <xref target="RFC6113">RFC 6113</xref> which states that
        "Mechanism designers should design FAST factors, instead of new
        pre-authentication mechanisms outside of FAST." However, this
        pre-authentication mechanism does not intend to replace FAST, and may
        be used with it to further conceal the metadata of the Kerberos
        messages.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="SPAKE Overview">
        <t>The SPAKE algorithm can be broadly described in a series of four
        steps:
        <list style="numbers">
          <t>Calculation and exchange of the public key</t>
          <t>Calculation of the shared secret (K)</t>
          <t>Derivation of an encryption key (K')</t>
          <t>Verification of the derived encryption key (K')</t>
        </list></t>

        <t>Higher level protocols must define their own verification step. In
        the case of this mechanism, verification happens implicitly by a
        successful decryption of the 2FA data.</t>

        <t>This mechanism provides its own method of deriving encryption keys
        from the calculated shared secret K, for several reasons: to fit
        within the framework of <xref target="RFC3961"/>, to ensure
        negotiation integrity using a transcript checksum, to derive different
        keys for each use, and to bind the KDC-REQ-BODY to the
        pre-authentication exchange.</t>

      with differences in detail. For simplicity, this document refers to the

    </section>

    <section title="Prerequisites">
      <section title="PA-ETYPE-INFO2">
        <t>This mechanism requires the initial KDC pre-authentication state to
        contain a singular reply key. Therefore, a KDC which offers SPAKE
        pre-authentication as a stand-alone mechanism MUST supply a
        PA-ETYPE-INFO2 value containing a single ETYPE-INFO2-ENTRY, as
        described in <xref target="RFC6113"/> section 2.1. PA-ETYPE-INFO2 is
        specified in <xref target="RFC4120"/> section 5.2.7.5.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Cookie Support">
        <t>KDCs which implement SPAKE pre-authentication MUST have some secure
        mechanism for retaining state between AS-REQs. For stateless KDC
        implementations, this method will most commonly be an encrypted
        PA-FX-COOKIE. Clients which implement SPAKE pre-authentication MUST
        support PA-FX-COOKIE, as described in <xref target="RFC6113"/> section
        5.2.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="More Pre-Authentication Data Required">
        <t>Both KDCs and clients which implement SPAKE pre-authentication MUST
        support the use of KDC_ERR_MORE_PREAUTH_DATA_REQUIRED, as described in
        <xref target="RFC6113"/> section 5.2.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="SPAKE Pre-Authentication Message Protocol">
      <t>This mechanism uses the reply key and provides the Client
      Authentication and Strengthening Reply Key pre-authentication facilities
      (<xref target="RFC6113"/> section 3). When the mechanism completes
      successfully, the client will have proved knowledge of the original
      reply key and possibly a second factor, and the reply key will be
      strengthened to a more uniform distribution based on the PAKE
      exchange. This mechanism also ensures the integrity of the KDC-REQ-BODY
      contents. This mechanism can be used in an authentication set; no
      pa-hint value is required or defined.</t>

      <t>This section will describe the flow of messages when performing SPAKE
      pre-authentication. We will begin by explaining the most verbose version
      of the protocol which all implementations MUST support. Then we will
      describe several optional optimizations to reduce round-trips.</t>

      <t>Mechanism messages are communicated using PA-DATA elements within the
      padata field of KDC-REQ messages or within the METHOD-DATA in the e-data
      field of KRB-ERROR messages. All PA-DATA elements for this mechanism
      MUST use the following padata-type:
      <list style="hanging">
        <t hangText="PA-SPAKE">TBD</t>
      </list>
      The padata-value for all PA-SPAKE PA-DATA values MUST be empty or
      contain a DER encoding for the ASN.1 type PA-SPAKE.</t>

      <section title="First Pass">
        <t>The SPAKE pre-authentication exchange begins when the client sends
        an initial authentication service request (AS-REQ) without
        pre-authentication data. Upon receipt of this AS-REQ, a KDC which
        requires pre-authentication and supports SPAKE SHOULD reply with a
        KDC_ERR_PREAUTH_REQUIRED error, with METHOD-DATA containing an empty
        PA-SPAKE PA-DATA element (possibly in addition to other PA-DATA
        elements). This message indicates to the client that the KDC supports
        SPAKE pre-authentication.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Second Pass">
        <t>Once the client knows that the KDC supports SPAKE pre-authentication
        and the client desires to use it, the client will generate a new
        AS-REQ message containing a PA-SPAKE PA-DATA element using the support
        choice. This message indicates to the KDC which groups the client
        prefers for the SPAKE operation. The group numbers are defined in the IANA
        "Kerberos SPAKE Groups" registry created by this document. The groups
        sequence is ordered from the most preferred group to the least preferred
        group.</t>

        </figure>

        <t>The client and KDC initialize a transcript checksum (<xref
        target="tcksum"/>) and update it with the DER-encoded PA-SPAKE
        message.</t>

        <t>Upon receipt of the support message, the KDC will select a
        group. The KDC SHOULD choose a group from the groups provided by the
        support message. However, if the support message does not contain any
        group that is supported by the KDC, the KDC MAY select another group
        in hopes that the client might support it.</t>

        <t>Once the KDC has selected a group, the KDC will reply to the client
        with a KDC_ERR_MORE_PREAUTH_DATA_REQUIRED error containing a PA-SPAKE
        PA-DATA element using the challenge choice. The client and KDC update
        the transcript checksum with the DER-encoded PA-SPAKE message.</t>

        <t>The group field indicates the KDC-selected group used for all SPAKE

        specified in <xref target="spakeparams"/>.</t>

        <t>The factors field contains an unordered list of second factors which
        can be used to complete the authentication. Each second factor is

        </figure>

        <t>The type field is a unique integer which identifies the second factor
        type. The factors field of SPAKEChallenge MUST NOT contain more than one
        SPAKESecondFactor with the same type value.</t>

        <t>The data field contains optional challenge data. The contents in this
        field will depend upon the second factor type chosen.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Third Pass">
        <t>Upon receipt of the challenge message, the client will complete its
        part of of the SPAKE algorithm, generating a public key and computing
        the shared secret K. The client will then choose one of the second
        factor types listed in the factors field of the challenge message and
        gather whatever data is required for the chosen second factor type,
        possibly using the associated challenge data. Finally, the client will
        send an AS-REQ containing a PA-SPAKE PA-DATA element using the

        </figure>

        <t>The client and KDC will update the transcript checksum with the
        pubkey value, and use the resulting checksum for all encryption key
        derivations.</t>

        <t>The pubkey field indicates the client's public key generated using
        the N constant in the SPAKE algorithm, with inputs and conversions as
        specified in <xref target="spakeparams"/>.</t>

        <t>The factor field indicates the client's chosen second factor data.
        The key for this field is K'[1] as specified in <xref
        target="keyderiv"/>. The key usage number for the encryption is
        KEY_USAGE_SPAKE_FACTOR. The plain text inside the EncryptedData is an
        encoding of SPAKESecondFactor. Once decoded, the SPAKESecondFactor
        contains the type of the second factor and any optional data used. The
        contents of the data field will depend on the second factor type
        chosen. The client MUST NOT send a response containing a second factor
        type which was not listed in the factors field of the challenge
        message.</t>

        <t>When the KDC receives the response message from the client, it will
        use the pubkey to compute the SPAKE result, derive K'[1], and decrypt
        the factors field. If decryption is successful, the first factor is
        successfully validated. The KDC then validates the second factor. If
        either factor fails to validate, the KDC SHOULD respond with an
        appropriate KRB-ERROR message.</t>

        <t>If validation of the second factor requires further round-trips, the
        KDC MUST reply to the client with KDC_ERR_MORE_PREAUTH_DATA_REQUIRED
        containing a PA-SPAKE PA-DATA element using the encdata choice. The
        key for the EncryptedData value is K'[2] as specified in <xref
        target="keyderiv"/>, and the key usage number is
        KEY_USAGE_SPAKE_FACTOR. The plain text of this message contains a
        DER-encoded SPAKESecondFactor message. As before, the type field of
        this message will contain the second factor type, and the data field
        will optionally contain second factor type specific data.</t>

      <section title="Subsequent Passes">
        <t>Any number of additional round trips may occur using the encdata
        choice. The contents of the plaintexts are specific to the second
        factor type. If a client receives a PA-SPAKE PA-DATA element using the
        encdata choice from the KDC, it MUST reply with a subsequent AS-REQ
        with a PA-SPAKE PA-DATA using the encdata choice, or abort the AS
        exchange.</t>

        <t>The key for client-originated encdata messages in subsequent passes
        is K'[3] as specified in <xref target="keyderiv"/> for the first
        subsequent pass, K'[5] for the second, and so on. The key for
        KDC-originated encdata messages is K'[4] for the first subsequent
        pass, K'[6] for the second, and so on.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Reply Key Strengthening">
        <t>When the KDC has successfully validated both factors, the reply key
        is strengthened and the mechanism is complete. To strengthen the reply
        key, the client and KDC replace it with K'[0] as specified in <xref
        target="keyderiv"/>. The KDC then replies with a KDC-REP message, or
        continues on to the next mechanism in the authentication set. There is
        no final PA-SPAKE PA-DATA message from the KDC to the client.</t>
        <t>Reply key strengthening occurs only once at the end of the
        exchange. The client and KDC MUST use the initial reply key as the
        base key for all K'[n] derivations.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Optimizations" anchor="optimizations">
        <t>The full protocol has two possible optimizations.</t>

        <t>First, the KDC MAY reply to the initial AS-REQ (containing no
        pre-authentication data) with a PA-SPAKE PA-DATA element using the
        challenge choice, instead of an empty padata-value. In this case, the
        KDC optimistically selects a group which the client may not
        support. If the group chosen by the challenge message is supported by
        the client, the client MUST skip to the third pass by issuing an
        AS-REQ with a PA-SPAKE message using the response choice. If the KDC's
        chosen group is not supported by the client, the client MUST
        initialize and update the transcript checksum with the KDC's challenge
        message, and then continue to the second pass. Clients MUST support
        this optimization.</t>

        <t>Second, clients MAY skip the first pass and send an AS-REQ with a
        PA-SPAKE PA-DATA element using the support choice. The KDC MUST
        include a PA-ETYPE-INFO2 value within the METHOD-DATA of the
        KDC_ERR_MORE_PREAUTH_DATA_REQUIRED error response, as the client may

      method defined in the IANA "Kerberos SPAKE Groups" registry created by

      <t>The SPAKE algorithm requires constants M and N for each group. These
      constants are defined in the IANA "Kerberos SPAKE Groups" registry
      created by this document.</t>
      <t>The SPAKE algorithm requires a shared secret input w to be used as a
      scalar multiplier (see <xref target="I-D.irtf-cfrg-spake2"/> section
      2). This value MUST be produced from the initial reply key as follows:

        <t>Determine the length of the multiplier octet string as defined in
        the IANA "Kerberos SPAKE Groups" registry created by this

        conversion method defined in the IANA "Kerberos SPAKE Groups" registry
        created by this document.</t>
      </list></t>
      <t>The KDC chooses a secret scalar value x and the client chooses a
      secret scalar value y. As required by the SPAKE algorithm, these values
      are chosen randomly and uniformly. The KDC and client MUST NOT reuse x
      or y values for authentications involving different initial reply
      keys.</t>

    <section title="Transcript Checksum" anchor="tcksum">
      <t>The transcript checksum is an octet string of length equal to the
      output length of the required checksum type of the encryption type of
      the initial reply key. The initial value consists of all bits set to
      zero.</t>

      <t>When the transcript checksum is updated with an octet string input,
      the new value is the get_mic result computed over the concatenation of
      the old value and the input, for the required checksum type of the
      initial reply key's encryption type, using the initial reply key and the
      key usage number KEY_USAGE_SPAKE_TRANSCRIPT.</t>

      <t>In the normal message flow or with the second optimization described
      in <xref target="optimizations"/>, the transcript checksum is first
      updated with the client's support message, then the KDC's
      challenge message, and finally with the client's pubkey value. It
      therefore incorporates the client's supported groups, the KDC's chosen
      group, the KDC's initial second-factor messages, and the client and KDC
      public values. Once the transcript checksum is finalized, it is used
      without change for all key derivations (<xref target="keyderiv"/>).</t>

      <t>If the first optimization described in <xref target="optimizations"/>
      is used successfully, the transcript checksum is updated only with the
      KDC's challenge message and the client's pubkey value.</t>

      <t>If first optimization is used unsuccessfully (i.e. the client does
      not accept the KDC's selected group), the transcript checksum is updated
      with the KDC's optimistic challenge message, then with the client's
      support message, then the KDC's second challenge message, and finally
      with the client's pubkey value.</t>

      for any cryptographic operation. Instead, the SPAKE result is used to

      <t>This document defines one second factor type:

      </list></t>

      <t>This second factor type indicates that no second factor is used.
      Whenever a SPAKESecondFactor is used with SF-NONE, the data field MUST be
      omitted. The SF-NONE second factor always successfully validates.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>All of the security considerations from
      <xref target="I-D.irtf-cfrg-spake2">SPAKE</xref> apply here as well.</t>

      <t>This mechanism includes unauthenticated plaintext in the support and
      challenge messages. Beginning with the third pass, the integrity of this
      plaintext is ensured by incorporating the transcript checksum into the
      derivation of the final reply key and second factor encryption
      keys. Downgrade attacks on support and challenge messages will result in
      the client and KDC deriving different reply keys and EncryptedData
      keys. The KDC-REQ-BODY contents are also incorporated into key
      derivation, ensuring their integrity. The unauthenticated plaintext in
      the KDC-REP message is not protected by this mechanism.</t>

      <t>Unless FAST is used, the factors field of a challenge message is not
      integrity-protected until the response is verified. Second factor types
      MUST account for this when specifying the semantics of the data
      field. Second factor data in the challenge should not be included in
      user prompts, as it could be modified by an attacker to contain
      misleading or offensive information.</t>

      <t>Subsequent factor data, including the data in the response, are
      encrypted in a derivative of the shared secret K. Therefore, it is not
      possible to exploit the untrustworthiness of challenge to turn the
      client into an encryption or signing oracle, unless the attacker knows
      the client's long-term key.</t>

      <t>An implementation of this pre-authentication mechanism can have the
      property of indistinguishability, meaning that an attacker who guesses a
      long-term key and a second factor value cannot determine whether one of
      the factors was correct unless both are correct. Indistinguishability is
      only maintained if the second factor can be validated solely based on the
      data in the response; the use of additional round trips will reveal
      to the attacker whether the long-term key is correct.
      Indistinguishability also requires that there are no side channels. When
      processing a response message, whether or not the KDC successfully
      decrypts the factor field, it must reply with the same error fields, take
      the same amount of time, and make the same observable communications to
      other servers.</t>

      <t>Weak checksums present a risk to the transcript checksum. Any etype
      with a checksum based on one of the following algorithms MUST NOT be
      used:
      <list style="symbols">
        <t>CRC32</t>
        <t>MD4</t>
        <t>MD5</t>
      </list></t>

      <t>Both the size of the EncryptedData and the number of EncryptedData
      messages used for second-factor data (including the factor field of the
      SPAKEResponse message and messages using the encdata PA-SPAKE choice)
      may reveal information about the second factor used in an
      authentication. Care should be taken to keep second factor messages as
      small and as few as possible.</t>

      <t>A stateless KDC implementation generally must use a PA-FX-COOKIE
      value to remember its private scalar value x and the transcript
      checksum. The KDC MUST maintain confidentiality and integrity of the
      cookie value, perhaps by encrypting it in a key known only to the
      realm's KDCs. Cookie values may be replayed by attackers. The KDC SHOULD
      limit the time window of replays using a timestamp, and SHOULD prevent
      cookie values from being applied to other pre-authentication mechanisms
      or other client principals. Within the validity period of a cookie, an
      attacker can replay the final message of a pre-authentication exchange
      to any of the realm's KDCs and make it appear that the client has
      authenticated.</t>

      <t>Any side channels in the creation of the shared secret input w, or in
      the multiplications wM and wN, could allow an attacker to recover the
      client long-term key. Implementations MUST take care to avoid side
      channels, particularly timing channels. Generation of the secret scalar
      values x and y need not take constant time, but the amount of time taken
      MUST NOT provide information about the resulting value.</t>

      <t>If an x or y value is reused for pre-authentications involving two
      different client long-term keys, an attacker who observes both
      authentications and knows one of the long-term keys can conduct an
      offline dictionary attack to recover the other one.</t>

      <t>This pre-authentication mechanism is not designed to provide forward
      secrecy. Nevertheless, some measure of forward secrecy may result
      depending on implementation choices. A passive attacker who determines
      the client long-term key after the exchange generally will not be able
      to recover the ticket session key; however, an attacker who also
      determines the PA-FX-COOKIE encryption key (if the KDC uses an encrypted
      cookie) will be able to recover the ticket session key. The KDC can
      mitigate this risk by periodically rotating the cookie encryption
      key. If the KDC or client retains the x or y value for reuse with the
      same client long-term key, an attacker who recovers the x or y value and
      the long-term key will be able to recover the ticket session key.</t>

      <t>Although this pre-authentication mechanism is designed to prevent an
      offline dictionary attack by an active attacker posing as the KDC, such
      an attacker can attempt to downgrade the client to encrypted
      timestamp. Client implementations SHOULD provide a configuration option
      to disable encrypted timestamp on a per-realm basis to mitigate this
      attack.</t>

      <t>Like any other pre-authentication mechanism using the client
      long-term key, this pre-authentication mechanism does not prevent online
      password guessing attacks. The KDC is made aware of unsuccessful
      guesses, and can apply facilities such as password lockout to mitigate
      the risk of online attacks.</t>

      <t>Elliptic curve group operations are more computationally expensive
      than secret-key operations. As a result, the use of this mechanism may
      affect the KDC's performance under normal load and its resistance to
      denial of service attacks.</t>

      <t>The selected group's resistance to offline brute-force attacks may
      not correspond to the size of the reply key. For performance reasons, a
      KDC MAY select a group whose brute-force work factor is less than the
      reply key length. A passive attacker who solves the group discrete
      logarithm problem after the exchange will be able to conduct an offline
      attack against the client long-term key. Although the use of password
      policies and costly, salted string-to-key functions may increase the
      cost of such an attack, the resulting cost will likely not be higher
      than the cost of solving the group discrete logarithm.</t>

      <t>This mechanism does not directly provide the KDC Authentication
      pre-authentication facility, because it does not send a key confirmation
      from the KDC to the client. When used as a stand-alone mechanism, the
      traditional KDC authentication provided by the KDC-REP enc-part still
      applies.</t>

      <t>The conversion of the scalar multiplier for the SPAKE w parameter
      may produce a multiplier that is larger than the order of the group.
      Some group implementations may be unable to handle such a multiplier.
      Others may silently accept such a multiplier, but proceed to perform
      multiplication that is not constant time. This is a minor risk in all
      known groups, but is a major risk for P-521 due to the extra seven
      high bits in the input octet string. A common solution to this problem
      is achieved by reducing the multiplier modulo the group order, taking
      care to ensure constant time operation.</t>
