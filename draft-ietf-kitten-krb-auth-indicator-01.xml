    <abstract>
      <t>This document proposes an extension in the <xref target="RFC4120">Kerberos
      protocol</xref>. It defines a new Authorization Data Type
      AD-AUTHENTICATION-INDICATOR. The purpose of introducing this data type is to
      include an indicator of the strength of a client's authentication in the service
      tickets so that the application services can use it as an input into policy
      decisions.</t>
    </abstract>
  </front>


  <middle>
    <section title="Introduction">
      <t><xref target="RFC4120">Kerberos</xref> allows secure interaction among users and
      services over a network. It supports a variety of authentication mechanisms using its
      <xref target="RFC6113">Pre-Authentication framework</xref>. The Kerberos Authentication
      Service has been architected to support password based authentication as well as
      multi-factor authentication using One Time Password devices or Public Key Cryptography.
      Implementations that have Pre-Authentication mechanisms offering significantly
      different strengths of client authentication may choose to keep track of the
      strength of the authentication used as an input into policy decisions.</t>

      <t>This document proposes a new Authorization Data Type to be used to convey the
      authentication strength to the application services. The KDC can provide the DER
      encoding of the ASN.1 type defined in this document into the ad-data field of the
      <xref target="RFC7751">AD-CAMMAC</xref> container. This ASN.1 type contains information
      about the type of authentication mechanism used by the Kerberos client to authenticate
      itself to the KDC.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Document Conventions">
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
      document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119">
      RFC 2119</xref>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="AD Type Specification">
      <t>The KDC MAY include the following Authorization Data element, wrapped in
      AD-CAMMAC, in the initial credentials and copy it from a ticket-granting ticket
      into service tickets:</t>

      <t>AD-AUTHENTICATION-INDICATOR       97</t>

      <t>The corresponding ad-data field contains the DER encoding of the ASN.1 type which
      is defined as</t>

      <t>AD-AUTHENTICATION-INDICATOR ::= SEQUENCE OF UTF8String</t>

      <t>Each UTF8String value is a short string that indicates that a particular set of
      requirements was met during the initial authentication.  These strings are intended
      to be compared against known values. They are not intended to store structured data.
      These strings MAY be site-defined strings that do not contain a colon such as the
      name of the Pre-Authentication mechanism used, or alternatively URIs that reference
      a <xref target="RFC6711">Level of Assurance Profile</xref>.</t>

      <t>The AD-AUTHENTICATION-INDICATOR MUST be included in the AD-CAMMAC container
      so that its contents can be protected. The AD-AUTHENTICATION-INDICATOR MAY safely be
      ignored by the applications and KDCs that do not implement this element.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Security Considerations">
      <t>AD-AUTHENTICATION-INDICATOR is wrapped in AD-CAMMAC which supersedes AD-KDC-ISSUED
      container. AD-CAMMAC allows both the application service and the KDC to verify the
      authenticity of the contained Authorization Data.</t>

      <t>KDC implementations MUST use AD-CAMMAC verifiers as described in the the security
      considerations of <xref target="RFC7751">RFC 7751</xref> to ensure that
      AD-AUTHENTICATION-INDICATOR elements are not modified by an attacker.  Application
      servers MUST validate the AD-CAMMAC container before making authorization decisions
      based on AD-AUTHENTICATION-INDICATOR elements.  Application servers MUST NOT make
      authorization decisions based on AD-AUTHENTICATION-INDICATOR elements which appear
      outside of AD-CAMMAC containers.</t>

      <t>Using multiple strings in AD-AUTHENTICATION-INDICATOR MAY lead to ambiguity when a
      service tries to make a decision based on the AD-AUTHENTICATION-INDICATOR values.  This
      ambiguity can be avoided if indicator values are always used as a positive indication
      of certain requirements being met during the initial authentication.</t>
